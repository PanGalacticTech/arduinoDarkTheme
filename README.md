# arduinoDarkTheme
Personalised Dark theme for Arduino IDE

Similar to One Dark Pro for VScode, with a few personalised touches


"Go to the directory where Arduino is installed.
The default directory is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\lib".
Rename the original "theme" folder for backup"

Then copy all files in "theme" folder a new theme folder.


Alternatively just replace the theme.txt files in the theme folder. 



Open the preferences.txt file for Arduino. 
The default location is C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Arduino15.
To help find it, you can also go into the Arduino IDE->File->Preferences 
and click the link on the bottom.



Remeber to close the Arduino IDE before editing the preferences.txt!

Change the line that says "editor.font=..." to the following:

"editor.font=Consolas, plain, 14"

This will give the Arduino IDE a font that looks very similar to the One Dark Pro theme.
