# arduinoDarkTheme
Personalised Dark theme for Arduino IDE

Similar to One Dark Pro, However navy background has been made grey


"Go to the directory where Arduino is installed.
The default directory is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\lib".
Rename the original "theme" folder for backup"

Then copy all of these files into a new theme folder.



Open the preferences.txt file for Arduino. 
The default location is C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Arduino15.
To help find it, you can also go into the Arduino IDE->File->Preferences 
and click the link on the bottom.



Remeber to close the Arduino IDE before editing the preferences.txt!

Change the line that says "editor.font=..." to the following:

"editor.font=Consolas, plain, 14"

This will give the Arduino IDE a font that looks very similar to the One Dark Pro theme.
